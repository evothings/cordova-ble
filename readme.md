## Cordova BLE Plugin

This plugin implements BLE support for Android and iOS. Enable your Cordova and PhoneGap mobile applications to communicate with all sorts of BLE devices.

Available functionality:

* Scan for BLE devices
* Establish connections
* List services, characteristics and descriptors
* Read and write the values of characteristics and descriptors
* Request notification of changes to the values of characteristics
* Poll RSSI (signal strength) of a device

### Use Evothings Studio for fast and easy BLE mobile app development

This plugin is used in Evothings Studio, and is compatible with Apache Cordova and PhoneGap.

[Evothings Studio](http://evothings.com) is a development and prototyping tool for making Cordova/PhoneGap apps. With Evothings Studio the edit/run turn-around cycle is just a second or two, which is much faster compared to the traditional method of rebuilding the Cordova project for each update.
